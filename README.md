## Linux Shell
A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input. When a program finishes executing, it displays that program's output.

## What is a Shell?
Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs, and shell scripts. There are different flavors of a shell, just as there are different flavors of operating systems. Each flavor of shell has its own set of recognized commands and functions.

## Motive
I will learn shell scripting with Linux based systems by follow HackerRank. Beside, it will help any future Programmer, who want to learn Linux Shell Scripting with a lot of examples.
